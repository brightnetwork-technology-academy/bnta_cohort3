# React Mini-Project

It's time to put some of your learning into practice! Over the next **two days** we are looking for each group to put together a simple front-end React app which interfaces with a supplied API. There will be **no large, formal presentations** for this project, as it exists for you to consolidate your learning ahead of the larger proper Client-Side Project starting at the end of this week (Nov 26th). We will, however, be **randomly selecting some students to present their work** at the end of Thursday (Nov 25th) so make sure you're present and contributing to your project!

The API we are asking you to utilise is a *countries* API which returns information about a selected country including *e.g.* the name of the capital city, the local currency, its (continental) region and a link to the relevant Google Maps page.

[RESTcountries API - end-points](https://restcountries.com/#api-endpoints-v3)

You will be working in pairs and will be building a **country bucket list**, combining the classic To-Do List example with novel data. You will find that there are some similarities between this project and the To Do list example you built earlier in the week. The API also affords great possibilities in regard to visual presentation so we are leaving the specifications for the projects fairly loose. In general, each group should:

- Interface with the RESTcountries API, loading the data into your app
- Save the loaded data using React's State management system
- Present the user with a list of countries which they can select from
- Create a means to mark a country as "visited"
- Display a list of "visited countries"
- Have a way to display more specific details of a selected country

Attempt to work your way through the points set out above but also *feel free to experiment and work in other areas that you feel you need practise with*. 

## Technology & Pointers

This project requires the use of **React**, which in turn will require you to utilise JSX, JavaScript, HTML and CSS.

As introduced during the teaching, we would recommend the use of either the in-built JS `fetch` method or the `axios` package for interfacing with the API.

The API you will be using is the **RESTcountries API**. To find a list of all countries included, visit the link below. This is also likely the endpoint you are likely to make use of:

[RESTcountries API - all countries](https://restcountries.com/v3.1/all)

You may find that the use of a JSON formatter will help significantly when getting to grips with the data the API returns.

*e.g.* [JSON formatter - JSON Pretty Print](https://jsonformatter.org/json-pretty-print)

## Project Management

As with the Server-Side Project you completed last week, you should create a **public GitHub repository** before beginning work on your code. Please again post the link within the Discord `#submissions` channel. We expect to see contributions for **each team member** within your group and would ask that you **push your final product onto the `main` branch** ahead of moving onto you Client-Side Project at the end of the week.

It is up to you how you organise yourselves and your time, however we strongly encourage the use of a [Kanban Board](https://kanbanize.com/kanban-resources/getting-started/what-is-kanban-board). Trello or GitHub Projects are great free services that allow you to organise your project this way.

**Communication is key** so if you do work individually at any point then please do make sure to communicate with your team where it is you're working. Keeping regular contact will ensure that your project runs smoothly and bettering these skills of project management will set you up well for any future roles.

## Next Steps

The primary aim for this project is to afford you time to work on your **Front-end / React knowledge** ahead of the main Client-Side Project. Our secondary aim is for you to further add to your **online portfolio** which you can present within any future interview processes. With this, we suggest that you spend some time together as a team putting together a cohesive vision for your app. 

Creating a rudimentary design can be a great first step. We suggest using with Miro or Figma for creating a wireframe of your site. Try to spend at least an hour discussing the aims for your project, organising both the *"What?"* and *"How?"*. We also suggest organising periods where each team member leads in an area that they are stronger in, explaining the process to their team partner. You have all been traversing this bootcamp together and you may find yourself surprised by the information you do know.

As with your previous project, we also encourage the creation of a succinct README.md file on your GitHub repo where you outline the aims of your project and what you have accomplished. If you would further like to detail where each team member contributed the most and any issues you faced, you may find it useful for future reference. That said, this task is significantly shorter, so please prioritise the coding over the admin.

Please do reach out to the mentors or trainers if you face any issues.

All that's left now is to see you off with a *"Good Luck!"* and a `create-react-app`!
