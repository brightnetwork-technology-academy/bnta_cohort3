# Loading Data from an API

For this task we'll be practicing loading data into our React apps. We'll be loading data from an external API, but th eprocess would be the same if it were coming from a local database.

## MVP

Take a look at the list of APIs in [this document](./api_suggestions.md) and pick one that particularly interests you. Create a new React application which loads data from that API into a container and passes it to another component to render to the page. You don't need to show *all* the data (some of the resources are quite big) but you should pick a few items and display them.

## Extensions

- Add another component which will enable the user to make another API call and load more data.
- Check your code for any potential refactoring. Could anything be abstracted into a helper method? 
- Show some more of the data you have loaded from the API. Think about the most appropriate elements to use to render it (`<img>`? `<ul>`? `<table>`?)
- Add some CSS to you app.
